    # Note there are some subtle interactions here.

    # If you have 4 CPU, 1 disk, then following https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
    # you would have a DB maxconn size of 10.  
    # 
    # However, using http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.0.0/database.html#database-thread-pool
    # you want to set the numThreads as 10 instead: 
    # 
    # "Its size is the main parameter to tune for the best performance of the Database object. It should be set
    # to the value that you would use for the size of the *connection pool* in a traditional, blocking application#
    #
    # Meanwhile, the default queue size is 5, so if this is the only database client then on the DB side you want maxconn to be 
    # 15 connections for the app (and a few spare for monitoring and admin).
    #
    # For the details, see:
